            what could be looked at in terms of boardgames, and where to get the information. BoardGameGeek is a 
            treasure trove of information, and because of this I have stood on the shoulders of those before me, and 
            gathered my own set of data to analyse. There is BGG data on Kaggle, but this is now very out of date 
            (5+ years old), and doesn't include the full data set available.""")
st.markdown("""Both Dinesh Vatvani and Markus Shepherd's scraping of Board Game Geek inspired me to start my own 
            analysis. I initially tried to update code I found that scraped BGG however I discovered Markus' 
            prescraped data contained much of the information I was interested in, so updated the scraper to pull the 
            last few bits from his public data.""")
