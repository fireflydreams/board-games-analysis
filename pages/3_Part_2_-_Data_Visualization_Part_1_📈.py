            look at is the most owned game according to BGG. Now this has to come with a couple of caveats. First, 
            BGG is only a snapshot of board game owners. Not everyone who owns any board games is on BGG. Second BGG
            is an enthusiasts cataloging/databse system. Enthusiasts often do not own some of the classic childhood
            board games such as Chess, Monopoly, Cluedo (Clue) etc, or do not register them as owned. Many sources cite 
            these as the most owned board games, so lets see what BGG believes to be the most owned:""")

st.markdown("""Having plotted the releases by year from 1950 onwards, we can see around the 1970s, there is a gradual
            increase in releases, which starts to pick up momentum. By 1990 we are starting to see the releases increase
            rapidly, however by early 2000s we can see the release numbers have doubled since 1990, and this trend 
            continues well into the 2010s. Generally speaking, we are seeing more and more games released every year.
            This appears to hit a peak in 2019, of 1440 games released. This is where we have to start to note global
            events. In early 2020 a virus that seemed to originate in China, spread worldwide and became a pandemic, 
            the likes of which had not been seen for almost a hundred years (influenza pandemic of 1918-1919). """)

st.markdown("""The COVID-19 virus caused a few things to happen:
- China shutdown ***all*** production. Nothing was made, which had a significant impact on board games. Cardboard became in 
short supply, meaning kickstarted projects went on indefinite hold, planned games stopped being produced, and games were
not assembled.
- Shipping became a huge problem. Shipping prices went massively increased due to backlogs, people unable to work due to 
lockdowns etc.
- Companies closed. With little to no income, as products couldn't be made, many companies did not survive the pandemic.
- Oil prices tanked. Once rich countries found themselves unable to sell oil as the world demand decreased due to lack
of requirement for travel etc, meaning individuals found themselves with less disposable income.""")

st.markdown("""Not all of these immediately impacted board game releases, however the impact can be seen in years to 
            come. In 2020 we drop 200 board game releases. This drop continues into 2021 and 2022, with the releases 
            almost halving in 2022. Board game releases are definitely slowing down.""")

st.markdown("""I theorise this could be because of a few different things:
- Kickstarters failing to fund:-
    - Less disposable income due to cost of living crisis, lost jobs due to COVID-19 etc.
    - Shipping costs putting off people from backing from outside their country. 
    - Loss of trust in Kickstarter campaigns as some failed to fulfill (see problems with shipping and China shutdowns).
- Companies liquidating. COVID-19 shutdowns went on some long, some companies ceased trading.
- Market Saturation. Are too many similar games being proposed/coming out causing people to evaluate if their need 
another 'x' mechanic game.
- China backlog. Too many items (not just board games) awaiting production, pushing production dates back, impacting
company profits.""")
