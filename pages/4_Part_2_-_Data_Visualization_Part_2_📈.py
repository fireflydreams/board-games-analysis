            correlates to the idea that games and combining more and more mechanics together. There are a few that need 
            calling out for their extreme fall from fashion. The first is roll / spin and move. This is a typical 
            mechanic seen in "classic" games such as Monopoly, Game of Life, Snakes & Ladders etc. In 2000 this mechanic 
            was used in over 20% of games released that year, in 2020 it was only used in 4%. This is a huge drop in 
            popularity, meaning alternative methods of movement are being used in games.""")
